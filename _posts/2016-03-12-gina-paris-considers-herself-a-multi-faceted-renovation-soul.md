Gina Paris is a multi-faceted Renovation Soul. She is an interior designer who's firm- Gina Paris Design- specializes in renovation and redesign,  an Energy Angel, Reconnective Healing(r) Practitioner (certified in Reconnective Healing Animals(r)),  speaker, wife, and mother of three children- plus two cats. 

Gina's holistic journey began 26 years ago when her mother, Lavina Jeane, became deathly ill. The two searched for innovative and cutting edge holistic medicine that would eventually help Jeane recover her health.  

In 1997 Gina's first child, Brady, sustained severe brain damage during delivery and was given two months to live. Again, Gina and Jeane searched for treatments outside of main stream medicine to provide a more comfortable life for Brady. Although Brady passed away November 6, 2012- at the age of 15 1/2, Gina continues to grow and learn about the metaphysical world, and enjoys sharing the healing gifts she's acquired with others so that they may find the peace, comfort and joy within this world that she has.
