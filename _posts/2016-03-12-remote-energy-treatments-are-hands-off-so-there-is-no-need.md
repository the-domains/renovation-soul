Remote energy treatments are "hands off" so there is no need to worry if you're in physical pain. I work with your energy field- not on your physical body.   
Your energy field is connected to all universal energy, which means that energy therapies may be facilitated from a distance.    
Remote healing sessions are equally effective as ones given in person, and allow you to remain at home.
