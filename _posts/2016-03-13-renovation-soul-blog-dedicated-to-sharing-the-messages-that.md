Renovation Soul is dedicated to sharing the messages that Gina and Jeane receive while working together on their own stuff. If you're reading this, then these angelic messages are meant for you as well- we hope they provide earthly wisdom, and bring hope and comfort into your life. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/56ceecf9-20b7-4405-827e-205b6f24f784.jpg)

Gina and Lavina Jeane's lives have been entwined since Gina's birth; they are mother and daughter.
The two have shared much of the same hardships, pain and suffering that you have; and conventional medicine gave them no hope. Together they journeyed into Holistic medicine and the metaphysical, and discovered how to heal themselves, bringing health, hope and happiness into their lives.
As they traveled deeper into the metaphysical world, Jeane and Gina learned how to listen to, and work with, angels to maintain their balance and health during the dramatic changes and every day ups and downs that take place in our lives.
Now, mother and daughter share their love, wisdom, and powerful healing gifts with others so that they too may find love and health. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/774db7bd-256f-4c7a-8741-fe1e9a9bf1aa.jpg)

Gina Paris is a multi-faceted renovation soul. Her interior design firm- Gina Paris Design- specializes in renovation and redesign; and as intuitive healer her focus is on spiritual overhauls of the soul.  

In 1997 Gina's first child, Brady, sustained severe brain damage during delivery and was given two months to live. Again, Gina and Jeane searched for treatments outside of main stream medicine to provide a more comfortable life for Brady. Although Brady passed away November 6, 2012- at the age of 15 1/2, Gina continues to grow and learn about the metaphysical world, and enjoys sharing the healing gifts she's acquired with others so that they may find the peace and comfort within this world that she has. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2b77db0d-6339-48d1-a6f1-47ed77a86943.jpg)

Gina is a Reconnective Healing(r) Practitioner- also certified in Reconnective Animals(r), inspirational speaker, writer, wife, mother of three, and so much more.

> Gina's ability to work with energy is amazing! She did a Reconnective Healing session with me that brought great results! 

Lavina Jeane Page is an international intuitive healer working with individuals as well as groups for over 35 years. After her near death experience 26 years ago, when she saw the Black Curtain and was diagnosed with multiple life threatening illnesses, Jeane was given only two short weeks to live. Through her own self discovery and spiritual journey Lavina has made a full recovery. Seeking innovative and cutting edge healing methods has led her to Reconnective Healing, holistic therapies, and Angel Attunements. Jeane now feels guided to share her healing gifts and her story so that others may be lifted up and healed.
