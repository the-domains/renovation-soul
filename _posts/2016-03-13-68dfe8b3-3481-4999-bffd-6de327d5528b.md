> Compassion goes hand in hand with love.

![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4ba9d825-3947-4051-93f4-b28116b6d6cb.jpg)

Compassion is different in a sense than pity or feeling bad for others- these are disrespectful. When you feel love, compassion just flows along with it. 

If you're internally ranting about someone... shift you're thoughts and allow compassion for them to float up.
