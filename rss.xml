            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Chakra Balancing & Clearing</h1><p>Cleaning and opening the dirty and/or blocked chakras. Chakras are the energy centers of our energetic bodies and they affect our physical bodies causing dis-ease when they become blocked, unclean, or both.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Remote Healing</h1><p>Remote energy treatments are “hands off” so there is no need to worry if you're in physical pain. I work with your energy field- not on your physical body. Your energy field is connected to all universal energy, which means that energy therapies may be facilitated from a distance.  Remote healing sessions are equally effective as ones given in person, and allow you to remain at home.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f432fdb7b9554445f94c073fdeabfd6a9e80d48e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
