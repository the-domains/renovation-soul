            <title><![CDATA[About Us]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>About Us</h1><p>Gina’s holistic journey began 26 years ago when her mother, Lavina Jeane, became deathly ill and Gina cared for her mother and her siblings. In 1997 Gina’s first child, Brady, sustained severe brain damage during delivery and was given two months to live. Together Gina and Jeane searched for treatments outside of main stream medicine to provide a more comfortable life for Brady. Although Brady passed away November 6, 2012- at the age of 15 1/2, Gina continues to grow and learn about the metaphysical world, and enjoys sharing the healing gifts she’s acquired with others so that they may find the peace, comfort and joy within this world that she has.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e3a39c3ddec36b747f8199e73305e769248bbd66.jpg"></article>]]></description>
